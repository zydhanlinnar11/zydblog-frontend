## Project Overview

This project aimed to create a streamlined online registration platform for the UTBK-SNBT exam, simplifying the application process for aspiring university students. Our project focuses on creating an efficient and user-friendly online registration platform for the UTBK-SNBT exam, addressing various complex requirements to accommodate a large number of applicants.

## Problem Statement

The challenges encompass multiple aspects of the registration process:

1. **Comprehensive Application:** Designing a user-friendly form for applicants to provide personal information, family details, and disabilities (tuna netra and tuna daksa), ensuring inclusivity.
2. **University Selection Constraints:** Implementing logic that restricts KIP-K recipients from applying to PTKIN/UIN institutions due to specific regulations.
3. **Subject Portfolio:** Developing a feature for applicants to submit subject portfolios where required.
4. **Pusat UTBK Seat Booking:** Ensuring a queue-based seat booking mechanism for Pusat UTBK to prevent concurrency issues and ensure unique seat assignments and payment codes.
5. **Secure Cards and Certificates:** Designing secure Kartu Pembayaran, Kartu Peserta, and Sertifikat UTBK with encrypted QR codes to prevent tampering.
6. **Handling High Traffic:** Strategizing for optimal performance and minimal downtime while accommodating a significant volume of 800,000 applicants.
7. **Payment Expiry Management:** Releasing exam seats within a specified time frame if payment is not made, allowing other applicants to utilize those seats.

## Solution and Features

To address these challenges, our UTBK-SNBT registration platform provides:

- **Intuitive Form:** A streamlined application form with sections for personal details, disabilities, and family information.
- **Dynamic University Selection:** Logic to enforce university selection constraints based on KIP-K status.
- **Subject Portfolio Upload:** A user-friendly interface for uploading subject portfolios where applicable.
- **Pusat UTBK Queue:** A queue-based seat booking system at Pusat UTBK to ensure seat allocation integrity.
- **Secure Certificates:** Sertifikat UTBK with encrypted QR codes to securely display exam scores.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Employing robust architecture to handle high traffic and ensure performance.
- **Payment Expiry Handling:** Automated release of unpaid seats to optimize seat utilization.

## Technologies Used

The project was meticulously crafted using a comprehensive tech stack, including:

- **Frontend:** Next.js, a powerful React framework, was chosen for its server-rendering capabilities, coupled with Chakra UI for a modern and consistent design language, resulting in a seamless and visually appealing user experience.
- **Backend:** Laravel, a robust PHP framework, was employed to build the backend infrastructure, with OpenID Connect used for secure and seamless authentication, ensuring user privacy and data protection.
- **Database:** Firestore, a scalable and real-time cloud database by Google Cloud Platform (GCP), was utilized to efficiently manage and store data, offering a reliable foundation for the application.
- **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) served as the backbone for the project's infrastructure, providing a scalable and secure environment to host and manage the application.
- **Security:** The implementation of encrypted QR codes added an extra layer of security, ensuring the integrity of critical data throughout the application.

## Design and User Experience

The platform's design prioritizes simplicity and clarity, ensuring an effortless application process for all users. The user interface was optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Development Process

The project followed agile methodologies with continuous iterations and close collaboration between frontend and backend teams.

## Results and Impact

Since its launch, the UTBK-SNBT registration platform has exhibited remarkable results and positive impact:

- **Enhanced User Experience:** The integration of Next.js and Chakra UI contributed to a smooth and intuitive user interface, resulting in increased user satisfaction.
- **Streamlined Registration:** The utilization of Laravel and Firestore allowed for efficient data management, leading to a seamless and error-free registration process for applicants.
- **Secure Authentication:** OpenID Connect implementation ensured robust and secure authentication, safeguarding user information and privacy.
